# Download List with Icons Preview

## Hints

The preview images are generated through WordPress. Whether and how they are created depends on whether WordPress and the hosting support the respective data format. For example, ghostscript is required in the hosting to generate preview images of PDF files.

The preview images are integrated using a style. If you want to display them larger, an individual style adjustment is necessary.
